                  <h6>Introduction</h6>
                  <p>If you purchase any Documents or Services from us, you agree to be legally bound by these terms and conditions, which form part of the contract between us.</p>
                  <p>You may only purchase Documents or Services from us for non-business, personal use. These Documents and Services are for your personal use only and cannot be purchased for any third party or resale. We will not be liable for any Document or Service bought for third parties or resold, nor for any related loss. You represent and warrant that any Document or Service ordered by you is solely for your own use and that you are acting as the principal and not as an agent. We disclaim all liability for any Document or Service intended for any third party.</p>
                  <p>By purchasing any Document or Service, you also agree to be legally bound by:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Any additional terms that may modify these terms and conditions. Such changes may be necessary for security, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of such changes by giving one month’s notice, or as soon as reasonably practicable if earlier notice is not possible.</li>
                      <li>Any specific terms that apply to certain Documents or Services. If you would like to see these specific terms, please contact our customer service team for details.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>All of the terms above are part of the contract between you and us, as though set out in full here.</p>
                  <p>We may change these terms and conditions, Documents, or Services, or discontinue Documents and Services to comply with changes in law or regulation, or to make minor adjustments and improvements. If legally required, we will notify you of these changes using the contact information you provide. If you notice anything that does not appear correct, please let us know.</p>
              
                  <h6>Information We Give You</h6>
                  <p>Under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013, we are required to provide you with certain key information before a legally binding contract is made between us. We aim to provide this information clearly and understandably, typically before you purchase any Documents or Services from us. Some of this information is also included in these terms, such as details on our complaint handling policy.</p>
                  <p>We will provide you with information about:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>The main characteristics of the Documents or Services you wish to purchase;</li>
                      <li>Who we are, our location, and how to contact us;</li>
                      <li>The total price of the Documents or Services, including any applicable taxes (or, if this cannot reasonably be calculated in advance, how the price will be determined);</li>
                      <li>The arrangements for payment, the completion of the Documents or Services, and the time by which we will fulfill the Documents or Services;</li>
                      <li>How to exercise your right to cancel the contract and any costs involved in doing so; and</li>
                      <li>Our complaint handling policy.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>This key information, as required by law, forms part of these terms and conditions, as though it is set out in full here.</p>
                  <p>If any key information changes after a legally binding contract between us has been made, we may only amend it with your agreement.</p>
                  <p>All Documents and Services are provided in English.</p>

    </ul>

    <p>You must also:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Be a permanent resident of the United Kingdom. If you are not, you may purchase a Document or Service with the understanding that we are not providing advice (including but not limited to legal or tax advice) specific to your situation, and that the Document or Service may not fully suit your individual needs. You agree not to hold us liable for any loss resulting from your use of such Document or Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>

        <li>Our Documents and Services are not intended for use (i) in a jurisdiction other than the one specified (i.e., either England and Wales, Scotland, or Northern Ireland, as applicable), (ii) in complex circumstances, or (iii) if you need specialised tax advice (including in relation to inheritance tax).</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Document Review</h6>
    <p>While we provide tools to create your document, we do not independently verify the accuracy of the information you enter. You are responsible for ensuring that the information you provide is complete, correct, and accurately reflects your wishes.</p>
    <p>We do not verify:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The identities of beneficiaries or executors.</li>
        <li>The accuracy of addresses, names, or other personal details.</li>
        <li>Your testamentary and/or mental capacity or whether the document was created free from undue influence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h6>Your Responsibility</h6>
    <p>You are solely responsible for ensuring that the will you create is suitable for your needs and for checking the document’s accuracy. We strongly recommend consulting a qualified advisor if you have any doubts about the suitability of your document.</p>

    <h6>Alterations to Documents</h6>
    <p>Changes you can make to Documents using our Services are limited to predefined fields, including your name, beneficiaries’ names, executors’ names, and asset descriptions. You may not and are not permitted to change or alter the main text of the Documents.</p>

    <h6>How a Legally Binding Contract is Made</h6>
    <p>The following outlines the steps to create a legally binding contract between us:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any quotation we provide before you place an order is not a binding offer to supply the Document or Service.</li>
        <li>When you place an order for a Document or Service through our Website, you are making an offer to purchase that Document or Service from us.</li>
        <li>Upon receiving your order, we will acknowledge it by email. This acknowledgement is not acceptance of your order. Paying for your Document or Service confirms your acceptance of these terms and our Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We may contact you to inform you that we do not accept your order. This may occur for reasons such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We cannot fulfill the order (e.g., due to a shortage of staff).</li>
        <li>We cannot authorise your payment.</li>
        <li>You are not eligible to purchase the Document or Service.</li>
        <li>We are not permitted to sell the Document or Service to you.</li>
        <li>There is an error in the pricing or description of the Document or Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We will only accept your order once we send you a confirmation email (the “Confirmation Email”). At this point:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A legally binding contract is formed between you and us, and</li>
        <li>We will begin processing your order as agreed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Unless we both agree otherwise, our contract will terminate automatically once we have delivered the Document or Service to you.</p>

    <h6>Providing the Documents and Services</h6>
    <p>We will make the Documents available to you either:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>As a digital download, accessible as soon as we have accepted and completed your order; or</li>
        <li>If you requested a printed copy, we will provide you with an estimated delivery date at the time of ordering.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you choose to have the Documents printed and posted to you, the delivery period and cost will be displayed on our Website. Documents will be sent to the address you provided at the time of ordering, and this address cannot be changed after the order is placed.</p>

    <p>If delivery of the Documents is delayed due to an event outside our control, we will notify you as soon as reasonably possible and will take reasonable steps to minimise the delay. While we are not liable for losses caused by such delays, you may contact us to end the contract and receive a refund if there is a risk of substantial delay for any Document(s) you have paid for but have not yet received.</p>

            
      <h6>Charges and Payment</h6>
      <p>We will provide you with the basis for calculating charges for Documents, Services, and any related goods (including additional charges such as delivery fees) to the fullest extent possible when you place an order.</p>
      <p>Our charges for Documents and Services are on a quotation basis, meaning we promise to complete the order at a fixed price.</p>
      <p>We only accept electronic payments, including credit and debit cards. We do not accept cheques or cash. Your credit or debit card will be charged, and you will be invoiced, at the time you place your order. All payments must be authorised by the relevant card issuer.</p>
      <p>If your payment is not received, we may charge interest on any outstanding balance at a rate of 4% per year above the Bank of England’s base rate. We will notify you by email if we intend to apply interest.</p>
      <p>The price of our Services is listed in pounds sterling (£) (GBP) and includes VAT (if applicable) at the prevailing rate.</p>
      <p>Please note, if you decide not to sign a Document after purchasing it, the price of the Document will not be refunded.</p>
  
      <h6>Voucher Codes and Promotions</h6>
      <p>We may offer voucher codes or promotions for our services. Voucher codes are subject to the following terms:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Voucher codes are non-transferable, non-refundable, and cannot be exchanged for cash.</li>
          <li>Only one voucher code can be applied per transaction.</li>
          <li>Voucher codes may be subject to additional terms and restrictions specific to each promotion, as communicated when the code is issued.</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h6>Right to Cancel</h6>
      <p>Due to the bespoke nature of our Documents, you are not entitled to cancel your order or return the Documents. However, you may return the Documents if:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>The PDF file we provide cannot be opened or is corrupted when you attempt to download it, or</li>
          <li>Any printed version of the Document is damaged upon receipt.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The right to cancel the contract under the Consumer Contracts (Information, Cancellation, and Additional Charges) Regulations 2013 does not apply to Documents purchased from us.</p>
      <p>If you receive a printed Document that is damaged, we will cover the return shipping costs. Replacements for faulty or damaged Documents will be provided within 14 calendar days of receiving the returned items or from the date you notify us that the digital Document cannot be opened or is corrupted.</p>
  
      <p>You may make changes to Documents free of charge for one year following our acceptance of your order. This one-year amendment period is a discretionary, complimentary service, separate from the Document or Service purchase price.

  <h6>Disclaimer and Limitation of Liability</h6>
  <p>Swiftwills is not a law firm and is not registered or regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority, Law Society of Northern Ireland, or Law Society of Scotland. Use of our Documents, Services, or Website does not create a lawyer-client relationship between Swiftwills (or any associated individual) and you.</p>

  <p>It is solely your responsibility to ensure that the Documents and Services you order meet your requirements and are suitable for your legal and tax needs. We accept no responsibility if the Documents and Services you purchase are not legally correct or suitable for your specific circumstances.</p>

  <p>When preparing Documents, we do not assume responsibility for, and will not verify:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Your identity;</li>
      <li>Your testamentary and/or mental capacity;</li>
      <li>Whether you were under undue influence when ordering or signing the Document;</li>
      <li>Whether the Document was signed correctly or in accordance with our guidance notes;</li>
      <li>Whether you understood and approved the contents of the Document; or</li>
      <li>Any third-party beneficiaries who may have claims against your estate or challenge the Document’s validity.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We provide guidance notes to assist you with signing and executing your Document according to the laws of the intended jurisdiction (England, Wales, Northern Ireland, or Scotland). It is your sole responsibility to follow these notes and ensure the Document is properly signed and witnessed. Failure to do so may result in an invalid and unenforceable Document. We accept no liability for the validity, execution, or enforceability of any Document.</p>

  <h6>Document Validity and Changes in Law</h6>
  <p>Your Document may become out-of-date due to changes in laws or regulations. We do not guarantee that the Document you order and sign will remain valid, complete, or accurate over time, and we have no obligation to inform you of such changes. Future reviews of the Document’s terms are solely your responsibility.</p>

  <h6>Review and Accuracy of Information</h6>
  <p>We do not review or verify the data you provide to create the Document, nor do we check for legal accuracy, correctness, or suitability. We cannot accept responsibility for the Document’s appropriateness or suitability to your unique circumstances.</p>

  <p>Our Documents and Services are suitable for use only within specific jurisdictions: England, Wales, Northern Ireland, or Scotland. If you reside, are domiciled, or have assets or liabilities outside these jurisdictions, exercise caution as the Document may not be suitable, and we accept no liability for its appropriateness or enforceability in other jurisdictions.</p>

  <h6>Free and Updated Documents</h6>
  <p>We accept no liability and provide no warranty for any Document made available to you free of charge or any Document originally purchased but later updated by you free of charge. For clarity, any free update service we offer is a discretionary complimentary service, separate from your purchase price, and may be modified or withdrawn at our sole discretion without notice.</p>

  <h6>Limitation of Liability</h6>
  <p>We disclaim all liability to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law. This does not affect your statutory rights. If found liable for any loss or damage, our liability is limited to the amount paid for the relevant Document or Service.</p>
  <p>We are not liable for:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Loss of profits, loss of data, or any indirect, special, or consequential loss;</li>
      <li>Losses resulting from commercial, business, or resale use of our Documents and Services.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This limitation does not apply to personal injury or death resulting directly from our negligence or any liability we cannot exclude under applicable law.</p>

  <h6>Further Disclaimer of Liability</h6>
